# Peregrine

The bot consits of two Programs: 
The whole Directrory is a Chrome Extention, which will perform the login to your chosen course.
Then, there is a Program to run on your PC, called PeregrineJVM.

In order to setup this bot, follow these Steps:

1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
2. Enable developer Mode
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Copy the ID (eg.: k√∂asjdfh)
5. Open the Directory "PeregrineJS" in IntelliJ
6. In line 35, change the id with the one you just copied
7. Build the project
8. Update the project in Chrome

9. Open PeregrineJVM in IntelliJ
10. Make sure that the browser path in line 12 is the path to your chrome (it usually is, but you never know)

For the proper use, dm me ;)
